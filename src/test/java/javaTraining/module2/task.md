Create an Animal class. Animal class should have
3 fields - age, size, color (don`t use public access level, nor default) - access level, instance variables
Provide interfaces for writing and reading Animal`s class fields. Name of the parameters should be the same as the fields (methods,encapsulation, getters, setters)
3 behaviours - eating, sleeping, making a noise. All 3 should just output corresponding behaviour to console.(methods)
Create another behaviour with the same behaviour name as when making a noise, but this time you should set what the output should be. (overloading, method parameters)
2 ways of constructing the Animal class - by setting only the age and setting all 3 fields at once. (Constructors)
Create 2 animal objects constructing those with different constructors. This should be done from a separate file. (main method)
Set all missing fields for the objects
Invoke all behaviours

Create more specialized classes of Animal - Cat and Dog (super)
 Override behaviour and fields from Super class (method overriding)
Is it possible to override instance variables
Provide interfaces for writing and reading class fields
Initialize Cat and Dog objects and set all instance variables.
Invoke all behaviors
Add new behavior to Animal class and make it so that it won`t be possible to override it in subclasses (‘final’ methods)
Purpose -class has a method implementation that should not be changed and it is critical to the consistent state of the object
Change Cat class so that it could not be subclassed (final classes)
Add new instance variable to Cat class and make it so that variable can only be initialized once and it won`t be possible to change the value afterwards(final variables)
Add a constant to Animal class
